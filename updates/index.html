What can Lina do? What are its limitations?
    Ability:
        Lina is an AI that is made to help user to do mathematical task as well as some coding based tasks. It was actually made by the creator to learn how an AI works, it was made as a test bot. It can work as a text assistant and help you do some basic tasks. 
    Limitations:
        It is not like it can do anything, it has limitations and the task it can do(Mathematical tasks) is also limited(To avoid crashes in server). It does not have a alogorithem to learn so it can only do what is stored in its system to do! It cannot generate text on its own it only works with the data that is stored in its system.
