            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Version 1.0</strong><br>
                    &emsp;Lina-1.0, the first ever version of Lina. 
                    It was a very simple model that takes user input then finds the exact match in its responses dictionary. 
                    If it is unable to find the match it will try to get the data from wikipedia, and finally if none of the response matches it will return 'Sorry I did not understand'. 
                    It was a fine model but the thing here was when I developed this model I did not know how to use this library so most of the time I got response as 'Sorry I did not understand'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Version 1.1</strong><br>
                    &emsp;Lina-1.1, an updated version of Lina-1.0. 
                    In this model I added more features like roman to decimal, finding factorial, convert decimal value to binary, etc..
                    In this version I had changes the UI a bit, feedback feature was added. 
                    The web UI finally has a dark theme and light theme. 
                    The files in this model are well organised and some bugs from previous versions were fixed but in this update the wikipedia feature was removed in this model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Version 2.0</strong><br>
                    &emsp;Lina-2.0 the latest version that is live right now you can check out the model now at <a href="https://lina.mrlwitwma.in">lina.mrlwitwma.in</a>. 
                    This model is a way better model compared to the previous versions. 
                    So this model take the user input filters the input then sends it to an algorithm that understand what must be return as a output, in case of maths task then input is filtered then a specific data is send to the fucntion that must be used to get the value then It finally returns the value.
                    The data in this model is a bit larger and the response system is way better too.. it takes the input then finds the data in the response dictionary then finds the best response then returns it.
                    The UI in this version is 100 time cleaner. Some chnages in the Settings has been made..
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Version 3.0</strong><br>
                    &emsp;Lina-3.0 the new model that is being trained.
                    More over Lina(2.0) is good but it is not considered as an AI model by most because it does not have the ability to generate text learn from its data and more reasons... 
                    So new model is being developed Lina(3.0) it is trained on response data it can generate text, write poems, stories, etc..
